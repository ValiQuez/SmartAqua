### Project Briefing

###### The Smart Aqua project aims to develop a cutting-edge device that offers smart automation and real-time monitoring capabilities to enhance the health and maintenance of aquariums and water systems. By leveraging the widespread accessibility of mobile phones, our device will enable users to efficiently control and monitor crucial factors, including pH levels and temperature, in order to create and maintain an optimal environment for fish. The target audience for this project includes both individual fish owners and establishments managing multiple tanks, such as pet stores and swimming pools, where achieving and sustaining an ideal fish habitat poses challenges due to the significant number of tanks or limited expertise.The project's success will be measured by the device's ability to automate maintenance tasks, provide real-time monitoring, and effectively meet the needs of our target audience.
